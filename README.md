# PKMN

A super awesome and high quality attempt to recreate the first generation pokemon games (Red, Blue, etc.) in C++. I will also attempt to remove many of the bugs that have plagued players for nearly 30 years at this point.
If I decide to torture myself I will try to do it in the GBZ80 assembly afterward. God help me.
