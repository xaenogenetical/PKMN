# PKMN

A super awesome and high quality attempt to recreate the first generation pokemon games (Red, Blue, etc.) in C++. I will also attempt to remove many of the bugs that have plagued players for nearly 30 years at this point.

I will try to make this a faithful recreation, meaning that while I will be leaving out many bugs (like the 1/256 glitch and the error in Focus Energy), I will leave in intentional features, however strange, such as bug being super effective against poison and no dragon-type moves existing besides dragon rage.

If I decide to torture myself I will try to do it in the GBZ80 assembly afterward. God help me.
